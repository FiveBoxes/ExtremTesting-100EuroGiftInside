# ExtremTesting-100EuroGiftInside
As part of testing the FiveBoxes app available on the App Store, we’re launching a challenge: can you decrypt a file encrypted with our app?

Whether you’re a pro or just want to test your luck, follow these steps and try to crack our test file!

1. Download the encrypted file from the project: 100€GiftInside.pdf.dlock  
2. Verify the file hash in Terminal: shasum -a 256 /path/to/file  
   Expected hash: 09a72af21a090babc74781ed495d312640838a2aa57044934207c8827d580cf7  
3. Download the FiveBoxes app for free on the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/fiveboxes/id6751731535  
4. Complete the account setup.  
5. Try to guess the decryption password — or use your skills and any tools you prefer to crack it.  
6. Enjoy your success: #100€GiftInside  
7. Prove you're the best! Share the password with us here or on BlueSky (@fiveboxes.bsky.social) and X (@FiveBoxesApp).

You can claim the gift with no other requirements.

If nobody claims the gift by December 6th, 2026, we’ll donate 100€ to an organization fighting for #Privacy.

Enjoy a safe and private holiday season!
